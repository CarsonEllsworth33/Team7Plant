# Overview
This code is soley for reading data from an arduino that is running the **Adafruit_DHT** library. The arduino is actually reading data from the physical DHT sensor. 
This demo uses the DHT11 sensor while Team7 has ordered the DHT22 sensor with the only major difference being that the DHT22 is a more accurate measuring sensor 
than its counterparts.
